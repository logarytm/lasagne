allocator_init():
Initializes new instance of allocator. `bitmaps` should point to
a block of memory meeting criteria:
- located inside `memory`
- aligned to `leaf_size` relatively to `memory`
- size equal to returned by function `allocator_bitmaps_size`
or be ALLOCATOR_EMPTY if location of bitmaps irrelevant.

allocator_init_free():
Marks given address range as usable for allocations. Memory for
bitmaps is automatically omitted. Must be aligned to `leaf_size`
relatively to the beginning of managed memory.
Zero returned on success, non-zero otherwise.

allocator_bitmaps_size():
Returns size of usable memory block which must be passed
to allocator_init.
